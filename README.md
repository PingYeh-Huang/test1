# Cat Grooming Appointment Form

This repository contains a simple online appointment form for cat grooming services. Open `index.html` in your browser to use the form.

## AI Recommendations

When the appointment form is submitted the values for your cat's age, weight and hair length are evaluated in `script.js`.
Simple rules provide recommendations which are displayed below the form:

- Cats weighing more than 6&nbsp;kg trigger a warning about potential obesity.
- Cats younger than one year prompt a note about special kitten care.
- Long haired cats are reminded to be brushed frequently.

If none of the rules apply, the message "No special recommendations." is shown.
